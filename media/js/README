A Simple International Country & State Drop Down

Automatically repopulates the state drop down based on the country selected with no page refreashes.

One of the complexities of a online store is international address pages.  Credit card processing and online shipping rate interfaces need the proper codes for the customers state and country.  The easiest way to make sure the customer uses the proper country and state codes is to use a drop down menu.  Now the problems begin.

Lets say the form starts with the drop downs for the United States and a list of all countries.  When the visitor decides they want Canada, that requires a whole new list of states (actually provinces).  This normally requires the page is submitted by Javascript and the page is redisplayed with the new list of states.

Submitting the page requires extra program logic to prevent the data from being validated, since the visitor is not ready for that and probly doesn't have the whole form filled out.  Submitting the page to get the new list of states also takes time and sometimes confuses visitors.

This JavaScript program solves those problems with simple javascrpt.
